                <p>
                    <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the
                    presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects
                    such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
                    and JavaScript
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content; and enable the <b>.css</b> file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                </p>
                <ul></ul>
                <li>
                    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                    more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</li>
                <li>
                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
                    (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a
                    free CSS validation service for CSS documents

                <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style
                    properties.

                    A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors,
                    and a declaration block.</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and
                    attributes in the markup itself.

                    Selectors may apply to the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
                    <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id</li>
                        <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a
                            period prefix e.g. .classname</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="declaration_block">
            <header>Declaration block</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists
                    of a property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon
                    (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single)
                    declaration may be used.

                    Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some
                    properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200
                    pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width).
                    Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also
                    abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify
                    both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000,
                    100%, 50%), hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).

                <p>
                    Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML
                    markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be
                    explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that
                    information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.

                    For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined
                    structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for
                    these elements is presentational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2
                    headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This
                    made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the
                    separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size,
                    borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for
                    on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis
                    for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[15]

                    For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as: <br>
                    <code>
  &#60h1>&#60font color="red">Chapter 1.&#60/font>&#60/h1>
  </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational
                    attributes: <br>
                    <code>
            &#60h1 style="color: red;">Chapter 1.&#60/h1> 
          </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when
                    the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file.
                    For example, suppose the document contains the style element: <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>
            &#60style> <br>
    h1 { <br>
        color: red; <br>
    } <br>
&#60/style>
          </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit
                    code. If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing
                    the style element to: <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>
            &#60style> <br>
    h1 { <br>
        color: blue; <br>
    } <br>
&#60/style>
          </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1
                    element.

                    The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax
                    similar to: <br>
                    <br>
                    &#60link href="path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="sources">

            <article>
                <p>
                    CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the
                    user, and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media
                    type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance, and property definition. CSS style
                    information can be in a separate document, or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple
                    style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being
                    used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that
                    authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the
                    highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style.
                    The process is called cascading.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules. It determines which styles apply to an
                    element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has
                    a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of
                    1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to
                    separate the "digits" (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of
                    11,11, not 121).
                </p>

                    Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate.
                    Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but
                    also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML
                    elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any
                    ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties,
                    but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color,
                    font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility,
                    white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display,
                    float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow,
                    padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet,
                    allowing for shorter CSS.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Whitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:
                    <code>body{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    is functionally equivalent to this one:
                    <br>
                    <code>
            body { <br>
   overflow: hidden; <br>
   background-color: #000000;<br>
   background-image: url(images/bg.gif); <br>
   background-repeat: no-repeat; <br>
   background-position: left top; <br>
}
          </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, multiple property values are indented onto their own line: <br>
                    <code>
            @font-face { <br>
   font-family: 'Comic Sans' <br>
   font-size: 20px <br>
   src: url('first.example.com'), <br>
        url('second.example.com'), <br>
        url('third.example.com'), <br>
        url('fourth.example.com'), <br>
}
          </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="history">

                    CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim
                    Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same
                    time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the
                    first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos
                    was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.
